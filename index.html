          <h2>Correlations Discovered Between Health Risks, Age and Income</h2>
          <h5>Poverty:</h5>
          <p>Poverty has several correlations with different health conditions which also happen to vary by state. The poorer your are
            the most likely you are to be without health insurance in states such as Georgia, Louisiana, New Mexico, Arizona and South Carolina.
            Interestingly in states such as New Hampshire, Maryland, Maine and Connecticut there is less poverty level but also less people without health insurance. Overall,
            there seems to be a correlation between lack of health insurance and poverty. There also seems to be a correlation between poverty level and higher rate of smoking and being 
            Obese. Please explore the data for yourself and find your state for where it lies.</p>
            <h5>Age:</h5>
          <p>In contrast to poverty levels, there doesn't seem to be a correlation between the age group and the likely-hood of being a smoker, 
            being Obese and being without healthcare. Of note, Texas stands out as an outlier, where most of its population lacks healthcare, independent of age, poverty and income.</p>
            <h5>Income:</h5>
          <p>Interestingly, the data regarding income levels is inversely correlated with the likelyhood of being a smoker, being obese, or lacking healthcare. Essentially, being opposite 
            to the data of poverty </p>
